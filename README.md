# Learning PHP by developing an interactive quiz app

This is a bare-bones stripped down version of a much bigger project I want to do, just
to start learning PHP.

Notes on the bigger more ambitious vision are in DatabaseDesign.txt.

**RECENT CHANGES**

- DONE Jan 6 2014 Geez this is ugly! CSS something prettier.
- DONE Jan 6 2014 Current stored procedure to return a random record is a stub - write real one.
- DONE Jan 15 2014 Changed response checking to ignore punctuation, case, and excess whitespace

**NEAR-FUTURE TO-DOS**

-  There must be a better way of supplying database connection credentials.
-  Create the rest of the database schema and file it here (most won't be used for a long time)
-  Answer matching needs to ignore punctuation and case ONLY if flagged as such
-  Answer matching needs to search serialized string of answers
-  See if I can javascript some prettier dynamic feedback when the answer is entered
