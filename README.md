# Learning PHP by developing an interactive quiz app

This is a bare-bones stripped down version of a much bigger project I want to do, just
to start learning PHP.

Notes on the bigger more ambitious vision are in DatabaseDesign.txt.

**NEAR-FUTURE TO-DOS**

- [ ] There must be a better way of supplying database connection credentials.
- [ ] Current stored procedure to return a random record is a stub - write real one.
- [ ] Create the rest of the database schema and file it here (most won't be used for a long time)
- [ ] Answer matching needs to ignore punctuation and case if flagged as such
- [ ] Answer matching needs to search serialized string of answers
- [ ] See if I can javascript some prettier dynamic feedback when the answer is entered
- [ ] Geez this is ugly! CSS something prettier.
