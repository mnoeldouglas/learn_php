SINGLE-PLAYER FLASHCARD MODE:
- can build and assign a deck, or have the computer build a deck given parameters
	- parameters: deck size, tags any/all, Types, 
		text only, visual yes/no, sound yes/no, use my cards only, use text answers flag, use multi-choice flag.
- computer delivers the cards in random order, you answer. 
- let's start by pre-populating Cards and Answers (text only! good grief!), and writing a web interface to pull cards, present
	the question to the user (no user control yet, mind you!), and match the answer.  OK?  OK!

LONG-TERM:
- effectively what we have is a crowd-sourced knowledge testing system.  Can appoint some users moderators and have them
	review questions, allow them to mark for deletion, to allow for crowd-policing, wikipedia-style. Or up/downvote,	for crowd-policing reddit-style.
- shorter-term, can have a "flag as inappropriate" on public questions & decks. Questions & decks can be
	forced private if they're inappropriate for all users.
- cards and decks should have a "mark for removal" flag as well.  This would cause them to be hidden from
	everything user-exposed, and would allow real deletion by query in the database (or admin interface)
